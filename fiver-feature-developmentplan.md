## Prioritization

1. **Platform Fee System** - Highest Priority
   - Critical for platform revenue
   - Relatively simple implementation

2. **Order State Management** - High Priority
   - Core functionality for user experience
   - Required for escrow implementation

3. **Escrow System** - Medium-High Priority
   - Builds on order state management
   - Critical for platform trust

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a structured approach to implementing the requested features. By following this phased implementation strategy, we can ensure that each feature is properly integrated into the existing codebase while maintaining system stability and user experience.

The most critical components are the platform fee and escrow systems, as they directly impact the business model and user trust. These should be prioritized in the implementation schedule.
