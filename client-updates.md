Trending Gigs Feature (like YouTube Trends)

Objective:
We want to show users which gigs are currently hot, high-performing, or getting traction—similar to YouTube’s trending page.

Logic to implement:

Ranking Formula (Trending Score):

Use a custom formula to rank trending gigs:

Trending Score = (Clicks + Saves + Orders in Last 24h) + (Reviews * 2) – (Refunds * 3)

Gigs with the highest trending scores appear in the "Trending Gigs" section.


Trending Gigs Section:

Show a horizontal scroll or grid of top 6-10 trending gigs.

Update this every 6 or 12 hours.

Optional filter: “Trending Today” / “Trending This Week”.


Badge: Add a small "Trending" badge on the gig card.


Why it works:
Shows clients what others are hiring for. Increases trust and boosts sales of top gigs while motivating editors to perform well to get visibility.
“New Talented Editors” Rotating Section

Objective:
Give visibility to new or lesser-known video editors to help them get discovered and booked.

Logic to implement:

Display:

On the homepage or a dedicated section, show 6 gigs from newer or less-booked editors.

These 6 gigs rotate every 1 hour.


Rotation logic:

Pick gigs from:

Users with 0-5 orders or joined within last 30 days.

Randomize 6 gigs and refresh hourly (store timestamp of last shuffle).

Ensure a user’s gig isn’t shown again until all others in this pool are displayed.



Label:

Add a tag like “Fresh Talent” or “New Editor Spotlight” above this section.



Why it works:
Makes new editors feel valued and gives them a fair chance. Also shows clients new options instead of always popular ones.
