# GigHubify Development Plan

## Project Overview
GigHubify is a marketplace platform for video editing services, similar to Fiverr but specialized for video editing gigs. The application allows service providers to create gigs and customers to browse and purchase these services.

## Current Status
The project is a React-based frontend application built with:
- Vite as the build tool
- TypeScript for type safety
- React for UI components
- React Router for routing
- Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Zod for form validation
- Firebase for backend services (authentication, database, storage) ✅

The UI implementation is well-developed with pages for:
- Home page with featured services, categories, and testimonials
- Explore page to browse services
- Service detail page to view specific services
- Sign in and sign up pages (Authentication implemented) ✅
- Become seller page
- Add gig page
- Blog, contact, and privacy pages

## Missing Functionality

### 1. Backend Integration
The application currently lacks a real backend. All data is mocked with hardcoded values in the frontend components.

Tasks:
- [x] Create a backend API service (Node.js/Express, Firebase, or another suitable solution)
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for:
  - [x] User authentication (signup, login, logout)
  - [x] User profile management
  - [x] Service/gig CRUD operations
  - [x] Reviews and ratings
  - [x] Messaging between users
  - [ ] Search and filtering
  - [ ] Payment processing
- [ ] Replace mock data with real API calls

### 2. Authentication
Currently, authentication is simulated with no actual login/signup functionality.

Tasks:
- [x] Implement real authentication flow
- [x] Add JWT or session-based authentication
- [x] Create protected routes for authenticated users
- [x] Implement user roles (buyer, seller, admin)
- [x] Add social authentication options (Google, Facebook)

### 3. State Management
The application could benefit from proper state management.

Tasks:
- [x] Implement global state management with Redux, Zustand, or Context API
- [x] Set up authentication state
- [x] Create state for user profile and preferences
- [ ] Add cart/checkout state management

### 4. Data Persistence
There's no data persistence currently.

Tasks:
- [x] Set up a database (Firebase)
- [x] Create data models for:
  - [x] Users
  - [x] Services/Gigs
  - [x] Orders
  - [x] Reviews
  - [x] Messages
- [x] Implement data validation and sanitization
- [x] Create service files for CRUD operations on all data models

### 5. Real-time Features
For messaging and notifications.

Tasks:
- [x] Implement real-time messaging between buyers and sellers
- [x] Create subscription methods for real-time updates
- [ ] Add notification system for order updates, messages, etc.
- [ ] Create a messaging interface

### 6. Payment Integration
No payment processing exists currently.

Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal)
- [ ] Implement checkout flow
- [ ] Add payment history and reporting
- [ ] Create order management system

### 7. Search and Filtering
Enhance the current exploration functionality.

Tasks:
- [x] Implement search and filtering services in the backend
- [ ] Create UI components for advanced search with filters
- [ ] Add sorting options
- [ ] Create category-based navigation
- [ ] Implement pagination or infinite scrolling

### 8. User Dashboard
Create user dashboards for both buyers and sellers.

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement seller dashboard with:
  - [ ] Gig management
  - [ ] Order management
  - [ ] Analytics
  - [ ] Earnings tracking
- [ ] Create buyer dashboard with:
  - [ ] Order history
  - [ ] Saved services
  - [ ] Reviews management
  - [ ] Payment methods

### 9. Testing
No testing framework is currently set up.

Tasks:
- [ ] Set up testing environment (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Write unit tests for components
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests

### 10. Deployment and CI/CD
Prepare the application for production.

Tasks:
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Implement build optimization
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error tracking
- [ ] Configure proper hosting and deployment

## Priority Order
1. Backend API and Database setup ✅
2. Authentication system ✅
3. State management for authentication and user profiles ✅
4. Service files for API operations ✅
5. API integration to replace mock data with Firebase data
6. User dashboards
7. Messaging UI implementation
8. Payment integration
9. Enhanced search and filtering
10. Testing
11. Deployment and CI/CD

## Timeline Estimation
- Phase 1 (Backend + Auth + State): 3-4 weeks ✅
- Phase 2 (API Integration + Dashboards): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3 (Payments + Real-time Features): 2 weeks
- Phase 4 (Search + Testing + Deployment): 2-3 weeks

Total estimated time: 9-12 weeks with a single full-time developer.

## Technical Recommendations
1. Consider using a BaaS (Backend as a Service) like Firebase or Supabase to speed up development ✅
2. Implement user authentication with Auth0 or Firebase Authentication ✅
3. Use TanStack Query (formerly React Query) for data fetching and caching
4. Consider using webhooks for payment notifications
5. Implement proper error handling and loading states throughout the application
6. Add comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
7. Ensure responsive design works well on all device sizes
8. Implement proper SEO optimization
9. Consider adding analytics for user behavior tracking
